## Notes

After having been playing a bit with [this](https://gitlab.com/mikrowezel/backend/granica) I decided to take a lighter approach.

* All libraries grouped together as a single dependency.
* A (still not fully developed) CLI to generate some base apps that can be easily extended using the same tool.
* Base apps:
  * Vanilla
  * [Authentication](https://gitlab.com/kabestan/repo/baseapp)
  * Authentication & Authorization (*)

(*) Initially RBAC, adding later more flexibility if required.
